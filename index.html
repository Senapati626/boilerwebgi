				<h1>Plates on Back</h1>
				<p>Paleontologists had long thought that Stegosaurus had two parallel rows of plates, either staggered or paired, and that these afforded protection to the animal’s backbone and spinal cord. However, new discoveries and reexamination of existing Stegosaurus specimens since the 1970s suggest that the plates alternated along the backbone, as no two plates from the same animal have exactly the same shape or size. Because the plates contained many blood vessels, the alternating placement appears consistent with a hypothesis of thermoregulation. This hypothesis proposes that the plates acted as radiators, releasing body heat to a cooler ambient environment; conversely, the plates could also have collected heat by being faced toward the sun like living solar panels.</p>

				<h1>Tail Spikes</h1>
				<p>Two pairs of pointed bony spikes were present on the end of the tail. These are presumed to have served as defensive weapons as Allosaurus bones with holes made by these spikes have been found, but they may have also been ornamental. The spinal cord in the region of the sacrum was enlarged and was actually larger than the brain, a fact that gave rise to the misconception that Stegosaurus possessed two brains. It is more likely, however, that much of the sacral cavity was used for storing glycogen, as is the case in many present-day animals.</p>

				<h1>Small Skull</h1>
				<p>Stegosaurus  had a long, narrow skull that was very small in proportion to its huge body. Its jaws were equipped with a toothless beak that helped the animal tear off low-lying vegetation. Stegosaurus and its relatives are closely related to the ankylosaurs, with which they share not only dermal armour but several other features, including a simple curved row of small teeth. Both groups evolved from a lineage of smaller armoured dinosaurs such as Scutellosaurus and Scelidosaurus of the Early Jurassic Period (206 million to 180 million years ago).</p>
